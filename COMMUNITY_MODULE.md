## Frontend Components

### Pages
- **CommunityPage**: Main community page showing all posts for a card
- **PostDetailPage**: Detailed view of a single post with all comments

### Components
- **PostCard**: Individual post display with voting and metadata
- **Comment**: Recursive comment component with nested replies
- **TimeUtils**: Utility for formatting timestamps as "time ago"

- **Real-time Voting**: Instant vote count updates

- **Edit/Delete**: Author controls for own content
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface

## Database Migration

The community tables are created via Alembic migration:

```bash
# Run migration
python3 -m alembic upgrade head
```

This creates:
- `community_posts` table
- `community_comments` table  
- `post_votes` table
- `comment_votes` table

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Post
```javascript
const postData = {
  title: "Best rewards for dining",
  body: "I'm looking for a card with good dining rewards..."
};

await communityAPI.createPost(cardId, postData);
```

### Adding a Comment
```javascript
const commentData = {
  body: "Great question! I recommend the HDFC Regalia...",
  parent_id: null // For top-level comment
};

await communityAPI.createComment(postId, commentData);
```

### Voting
```javascript
await communityAPI.voteOnPost(postId, 'upvote');
await communityAPI.voteOnComment(commentId, 'downvote');
```

## Security Features

- **Authentication Required**: All write operations require valid JWT token
- **Authorization**: Users can only edit/delete their own content
- **Input Validation**: All inputs validated with Pydantic schemas
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Using SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Rate Limiting**: Can be easily added with FastAPI middleware

## Performance Optimizations

- **Database Indexes**: Proper indexing on foreign keys and timestamps
- **Pagination**: Efficient pagination with skip/limit
